As a user experience designer, I believe that human-centered design is our best shot at solving some of the world's most challenging problems. Iâ€™ve led user experience projects for IBM, GE, and Assurant.

As a Park Scholar at N.C. State University I earned a B.A. in Communication, and I was awarded grants for public opinion research.

> In 2013, I worked with N.C. State researchers to poll Key West residents on the use of genetically modified mosquitos to drive down mosquito populations and related diseases.
